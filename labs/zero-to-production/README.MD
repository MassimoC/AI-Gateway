## [Zero-to-Production lab](zero-to-production.ipynb)

Playground to create a combination of several policies in an iterative approach. We start with load balancing, then progressively add token emitting, rate limiting, and, eventually, semantic caching. Each of these sets of policies is derived from other labs in this repo.

### Prerequisites

- [Python 3.12 or later version](https://www.python.org/) installed

### üöÄ Get started

Proceed by opening the [Jupyter notebook](zero-to-production.ipynb), and follow the steps provided.

### üóëÔ∏è Clean up resources

When you're finished with the lab, you should remove all your deployed resources from Azure to avoid extra charges and keep your Azure subscription uncluttered.
Use the [clean-up-resources notebook](clean-up-resources.ipynb) for that.
