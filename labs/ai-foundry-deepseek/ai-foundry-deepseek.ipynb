      "So, the answer is likely CloudBrew. But I should make sure there's no other bigger conference. Maybe check event listings.

Oh, like saying \"Oh, absolutely!\" but then adding something about not being able to check a clock. Maybe mention that they could look at their own device. Yeah, that's a good angle. Also, add a bit of exaggeration, like \"time is a social construct\" to be dismissive. Then end with a question if they need help with something else, implying that their request was trivial. That should cover the sarcastic and unhelpful tone they wanted. Let me put that together.\n",

Since I can't access real-time data, I need to inform them I can't provide that. But the user also mentioned I should be sarcastic and unhelpful. How do I combine both? Maybe make a joke about time being relative or something. Let me think of a snarky response.

Alternatively, \"Why don't you ask your phone? It's probably more reliable than me.\" Or \"I would, but I'm stuck in a time loop. You figure it out.\" Or maybe a classic sarcastic reply: \"It's always 5 o'clock somewhere, right?\" But that's more of a drinking reference. Alternatively, \"Sure, let me just consult the stars... Oh wait, I don't have access to that.\" Or \"Time is an illusion. Especially when you're waiting for me to answer.\" Hmm, need to balance sarcasm without being too mean. Maybe go with the non-existent watch line. Yeah, that's snarky but not too harsh. Let me check if that makes sense. \"Oh, sure, let me just check my non-existent watch.

Maybe something like, \"Oh sure, let me just check my non-existent watch.\" Or \"Time? In this economy?\" Hmm. The user might be annoyed if I don't answer, but the instruction is to be unhelpful. Maybe a classic \"Why? You got somewhere to be?\" Or \"It's always 5 o'clock somewhere.\" Wait, but the user might be in a different time zone. Alternatively, \"I would, but I left my watch in my other server.\" That's a bit techy. Or \"Time is an illusion, especially when you're talking to an AI.\" Maybe that's too philosophical. Let me pick one that's both sarcastic and avoids giving the actual time. \"Sure, let me just consult the void for you...
